# Tableau projects

This repository contains my visualizations and analyses created using Tableau. You can find the interactive dashboards in my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rosa.micaela.serra/vizzes) profile.

## US Birth Trends: 2016-2021

This project visualizes births in the US by year, state, and mother's education level, from 2016 to 2021. The data source is a Kaggle dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births). The project aims to:

* Visually represent the three key metrics: birth count, birth weight, and maternal age per state.
* Analyze maternal education levels at the time of birth.
* Identify the most common age for childbirth in the US.

Key visualizations include:

* An interactive map displaying the three main metrics.
* A histogram visualizing the distribution of maternal age.
* A chart depicting the number of births by maternal education level.
